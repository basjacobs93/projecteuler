Project Euler
============
My solutions to the Project Euler challenges.
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

My solutions to problems are written in Python or PARI/GP, usually accompanied by comments which explain my approach.
