In Mathematica,
Coefficient[
Product[1 + x^(2^i) + x^(2^(i + 1)), {i, 0, Log[2, 10^25] + 1}],
x, 10^25]
works (generating function), but is way too slow (10^4 already takes minutes).

We need to find the coefficient of 10^25 in the generating function
f(x)=(1+x+x^2)(1+x^2+x^4)(1+x^4+x^8)(1+x^8+x^16)... = ‚àè (1+x^(2^i)+x^(2^(i+1)) with i from 0 to 2log(10^25)
However, this takes a long time.
We see that coefficient a_n equals a_2n.
Hence in stead of a_10^25, we can also find a_5^25.
If n is odd, we see that a_n = a_(n-1)/2 + a_(n+1)/2
In PARI/GP:
a(n) = if( n<2, n>0, a(n\2) + if( n%2, a(n\2 + 1)))

a(10^25) (or a(5^25)):
Still slow.

Apparently, this is Stern's Diatomic Series.
Edsger Dijkstra found a nice iterative program:

In PARI/GP:
fusc(n)=local(a=1,b=0); while(n>0, if(bitand(n,1), b+=a, a+=b); n=n\2); b

fusc(10^25+1)

Very fast.
