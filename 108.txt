For n, 
numbers x such that (x-n)|(nx) are what we are looking for.
Numbers x=n+m for m|n^2 work.

Hence we need to count the number of divisors of n^2 less than n to find the number of distinct solutions.
The first n for which this yields more than 1,000 divisors is the one we're looking for.

PARI/GP:
? for(i=1,i=10^9,if((numdiv(i^2)+1)/2>1000,print(i);break))
